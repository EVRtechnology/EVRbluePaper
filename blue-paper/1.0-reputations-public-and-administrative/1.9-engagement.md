# 1.9 Engagement

#### Overview

The person who drafts & posts an Opportunity is called the Initiator, the person who expresses interest in that opportunity is called the Respondent.&#x20;

Engagements provide explicit (non-binding) confirmation of mutual interest through a 3 step process:

1\) The Initiator posts an Opportunity,

2\) The Respondent signals their interest (offering to participate),&#x20;

3\) If Initiator then agrees to accept the offer of participation by the Respondent, this is an Engagement.&#x20;

Explicit (non-binding) confirmation of intent is expressed later when:

4\) The Engagement begins when both parties manually affirm their participation \[scanning of a qr code or some-such], creating a Verified Interaction which can be reviewed later.

5\)  The Engagement is completed when the prescribed Opportunity is finished.&#x20;



The same process as above, but as a dialogue:

1\) Initiator: "_"I would like to have cake. Does anyone else want cake?"_

2\) Respondent: _"Yes. Can I join? "_

3\) Initiator _"Yes."_

4\) Both: _"Here is the cake, let's have some."_

5\) Either: _"I've had my fill of cake for now, thank you."_



#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

A person creates and posts an Opportunity, another person expresses interest. When the two agree to meet we call this an Engagement.&#x20;

The Engagement is completed when the specified activity is ended by either party.
