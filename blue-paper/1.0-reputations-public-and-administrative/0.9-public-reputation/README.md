# 0.9 Public Reputation

#### Overview

Reputations are broken down into two types: Public and Administrative.

Public reputations are visible to everyone and help members make informed decisions about whom to interact with, and in what capacity. They are calculated using inputs (opportunity reviews) from other members

Administrative reputations remain invisible to other members, and assist in community governance processes. They are calculated based on the outcomes of arbitration and past reviewing behaviors.

Administrative reputations include: Billings score, Culcus score, and Bayesian adjustment

Public reputations include: nature, communication, and aptitude

Guilds hold public reputations as well and include Meaningful, fun & approachable,

All are subject to demurrage,&#x20;

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Public Reputations are displayed as a part of a Member's profile.

They are calculated from the reviews a member receives following a verified interaction (-after participating in an Opportunity)

Administrative reputations are gathered anytime an arbitration process is completed
