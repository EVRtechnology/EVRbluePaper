# 0.9 Public Reputation: General- & Specific-

#### Overview

Public Reputations work to encourage pro-social behavior.&#x20;

Administrative Reputations work to disencourage anti-social behaviour.&#x20;

Public Reputations are visible to others, and serve to assist in decisions about whom to engage with, & in what capacity. They concern aspects of Aptitude, Nature, and Communication. They are earned through Verified Interactions with members of the EVR community, and issued via the Social Recognition Software

Administrative Reputations are invisible to others, and serve keep the platform running smoothly. They include a member's BillingsScore, PotenzaIndex, and Bayesian disposition \[<mark style="color:red;">bayes adjustment, or something simiar -the bias coutering thing</mark>]. They are earned through participation in Content Mediation, and Engagement-Review process \[<mark style="color:red;">make a page explaining this</mark>], and issued via the Community Governance Structure.

There are many other factors (explicit, implied, & circumstantial) that factor into individual & administrative decision making: Awards, achievements, flags, guild membership, time-in-guild, rank, geography, availability, etc. But Reputations are the most meritocratic (and we believe most valuable) delineation.&#x20;



It's not fair, or informative to reduce a members reputation down to context-specific, or global...

to over-generalize a persons nature, communication, or aptitude. Likewise, it's not accurate to compartmentalize a persons character context-specific   Suppose a Member is able to communicate very clearly in one field, but is less articulate in others.&#x20;

Or is generally quite magnanimous, but less so when engaged a specific endevor.&#x20;

Very skilled in one arena, and less so in another.&#x20;



#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

When a person is trying to make a choice in whether ot not to interact with someone, its useful to have an idea of who it is your dealing with

It is the sum of all the other reputations combined
