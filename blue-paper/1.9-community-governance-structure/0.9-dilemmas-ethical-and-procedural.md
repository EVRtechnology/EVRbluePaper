# 0.9 Dilemmas: Ethical and Procedural

#### Overview

Dilemmas are what Arbitrating Members review and make determinations on.&#x20;

They include a brief, and copy of the disputed content (with personally identifying information removed)

Both Ethical and Procedural dilemmas follow the same arbitration process, the functional difference being which candidate pool the arbitrators are drawn from.\


The candidate pool of arbitrators for Ethical dilemmas is made of all members from its regional language family (the largest candidate pool possible requiring only literacy in the relevant language).&#x20;

The candidate pool of arbitrators for Procedural Dilemmas begins with members of the guild in which the disputed content appears. It then expands (as needed) to include members of its Parent guild. The candidate pool can be expanded in this way till it includes all members of a regional language family.&#x20;

(eg: The Humans couldn’t resolve the dilemma, so they asked the other Primates…&#x20;

\-Who also couldn’t figure it out, so they asked the other Mammals…

\-Who also couldn’t figure it out, so they asked the other Vertebrates…

\-Who also couldn’t figure it out, so they asked the entire Animal kingdom…

\-Who also couldn’t figure it out, so they decided to leave things as they were. )

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Dilemmas are presented to members selected as arbitrators, who have elected to engage in the arbitration process..&#x20;
