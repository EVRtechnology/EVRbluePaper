# 1.9 Community Governance Structure

#### Overview

BIG picture What it does: Our Community Governance Structure fulfills the platform’s needs for both content moderation and in-app administrative functions. Allowing EVR to operate without the “need” for bureaucracy intervention, or external oversight.&#x20;

Definition:  The set of protocols and associated metrics needed to facilitate self-regulation.&#x20;

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Community Governance processes are initiated whenever a procedural or ethical dilemma arises, and whenever Guild level decisions need be made.\
