# 0.9 Ordinal Guild

#### Overview

Ordinal Guilds differ from guilds in that they have a templates for assessing FDC’s and have at least one rank. Guilds that include FDC’s and atleast one level

So named because they provide additional direction to those wanting to pursue guild activities, engage with the activities of a guild

For guild focused not only on the mission but on training/teaching people how to do a thing. More broadly.

Depending on their charter, some guilds may benefit from standardized FDCs and a ranking system to let people know how to up-skill, how to gain proficiency, how to advance within the guild, become more useful, more involved in the guild.

Ordinal guilds are more ordered, more structured than their non-ordinal counterparts, which is helpful if the guild is more tradesman oriented. They provide a more clear cut path to doing a certain thing, provide more direction

Eg

Watershed management, one for removing invasive species, another identify habitats, surveying, another for falling trees,

Rock climbing guild -safety measures, etiquette

Co-op: courtesy clerk, checker, manager, inventory,
