# 0.9 Guild Certification

#### Overview

Local, Regional, national, institutional

Quisque congue elit eu tortor ullamcorper sollicitudin. In non est tincidunt, pulvinar leo ac, consequat eros. Sed scelerisque at diam eget dapibus. Donec ut tristique nulla. Donec massa nunc, dictum in libero vel, suscipit accumsan mauris. A guild who has adopted local, regional, national, or institutional standards.

The training and accountability standards of many organizations can fit nearly into the EVR framework with minimal formatting.

An existing authority uses EVR to improve or expand its operations,

Requires a convening or whatever level of authority to determine and standardize FDC’s, Ranks, SWP’s, and SOP’s

Authorities can be self identified as well.

Must explicitly say who the standards are determined by, must be issued by that authority, authority must be clearly designated and sign off on the process.

Account for service hours, is now waiting on test. Can include but doesn’t have to state certifications.

Certified fair trade or organic

Licensed elect
