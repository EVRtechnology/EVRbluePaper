# 2.0 Introducing EVR

### Into the breach,

We are at a threshold. The challenges we face today in industry and education, socially and politically, economically and environmentally, require that we take action; -the sort of dynamic, collective action that no individual, institution, or state, is capable of taking. The solutions we need will not manifest through top-down policy change but through grassroots organization. EVR is designed to meet that need by facilitating novel collaborations & innovations, and by deepening our appreciation for one another, and for ourselves.

### a cartography company for a changing landscape.&#x20;

The beaten-path has become largely impassible. It's time to embrace those roads less traveled, blaze new trails, and forge new paths. EVR provides the toolkit for our Members to collectively map, manage, and navigate their social & vocational environments. Every individual's journey is unique and deserves the benefits that communities of practice & support offer.&#x20;
