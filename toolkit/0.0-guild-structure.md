# 0.0 Guild structure

Despite the over romanticizing of ragged individualism, we are a profoundly social species.  Most all of us are naturally drawn to seek belonging within the group.  The truth is that strength, resilience, even freedom are all increased through cooperation.&#x20;

&#x20;It's easy to understand the resistance, even resentment, of  becoming "dependent" on something other than oneself. But keep in mind: Obligatory codependence is very different from selectively cultivated interdependence. The difference has to do with accountability, with agency, and with choice.&#x20;



There is no such thing as a self-made man, just ask your mother.&#x20;

Shoulders of giants,&#x20;
