# 1.0 Public Reputation

#### Philosophy

Before titles, ranks, & honorifics, Reputation is what guides people into relationship with one another.&#x20;

In their "natural state" reputations are a sort of crowdsourced expectation we hold about a person, gathered from the direct personal experiences of others. -A precursor to provide the initial context & pretext for initialing a new, unique, & distinct interpersonal relationship of our own.  Reputations push our awareness beyond Dunbars number and expand our candidate pool of mutually beneficial relationships.&#x20;

Ultimately reputation informs which people we take a chance on (and who we avoid), a very powerful function of immeasurable value -_when authentic_. But once scaled to the point of anonymity, this decisive function can take a nasty turn and be conscripted to meet less-than-sincere ends. Because reputation also informs which businesses we frequent, what brands we buy, what & whom we perceive as an authority, which ideologies we support, whom we want to be associated with... (and on and on); all too often they are obfuscated or contrived as a means to an ulterior end. &#x20;

As both a decision- & sense- making metric, reputations aren't going anywhere. Our achievement is to source & apply them in just course.&#x20;
