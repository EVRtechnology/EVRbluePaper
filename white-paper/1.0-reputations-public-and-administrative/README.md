# 1.0 Reputations: Public & Administrative

#### Philosophy

The situations we find ourselves in have a huge impact on which parts of ourselves we choose to enhance & which we diminish, which we reveal & which we hide. Simply by being placed in a context can awaken or quell all sorts of dispositions, some of which we might not even be aware of.&#x20;

It's important to acknowledge that our public personas change; sometimes at will & sometimes in spite of it. And equally important to accept that they don't have to be congruent in order to be authentic.&#x20;

Some of the most profound shifts take place under the conditions of anonymity. While there is certainly power in recognition, there is freedom in remaining anonymous. Often that freedom comes at the price of accountability, which can leave a space practically ungovernable. Yet anonymity is sometimes the only condition where people feel safe to have a voice.&#x20;

So...  to maintain governance without silencing the voice of vulnerable populations, we've created two separate categories of reputation: Public & Administrative.&#x20;

Public Reputations are what you'd assume them to be: earned through interaction in the public-sphere and visible to all.

Administrative Reputations are a bit different. They're earned through participation on-app, but are only used algorithmically by the Community Governance System. This category of reputation means that people can be held accountable without being made visible.&#x20;

#### Examples

Jeremiah may seem abrasive at times, but is conscientious and sympathetic to the concerns of others.&#x20;

Jerome gets anxiety voicing his opinions publicly, but speaks articulately & freely otherwise.&#x20;

Jacqueline is a real great gal when you meet her in person, but a bit of ideologue online.
