# 0.9 Code of conduct

#### Philosophy

<mark style="color:red;">lorem</mark>

#### Examples

Avoid the bad -isms: racist, sexism, etc

Practice Consent/respect/ lack of entitlement -be willing to be told “no”, don't try to punish people for their non-interest, don't be a douche. Respectful of time, Dont be fucking entitled to peoples time dont violate the sovereignty of others.

Have Patience/compassion -this is an imperfect world of imperfect people, and this is an inherently imperfect system. Plz understand that everyone is doing their best, and realize that there is no ONE thing that will make or break

Be authentic/honesty/integrity - don't make shit up, strawman, or rabble rouse. don't misrepresent yourself or your interests, actually do the thing you say you're doing,
