# 1.0 Arbitrating Members

#### Philosophy

It is important that no person be excluded from decision making processes, and equally important that no one person be included in every process either. ]

Arbitrators are drawn at random from the largest candidate pool possible to both include and limit the impact of individual interests on decision making processes.

Non-participation, or non-response is an equally valid form of contribution to the arbitration process. Itâ€™s not only unfair, but unwise to force a response from someone who may not have the time, interest, or background to form a calm, compassionate, and considered opinion..
