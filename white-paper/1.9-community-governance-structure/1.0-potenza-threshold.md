# 1.0 Potenza Threshold

#### Philosophy

Any piece of content, and any decision about that content has the right to be redressed, but not to exist indefinitely as a perennial issue.

The Arbitration threshold ensures that there is sufficient initial interest in a Dilemma to warrant the time/attention/and efforts of other Members.

Time, energy & attention are finite resources not to be taken for granted, efforts shall be taken to conserve each.

#### Examples

Garth is insistent that tobacco should not be included in the medicinal herbsguild and poses dilemma, he learns that a people from the guild have already adjudicated on the issue, and now requires 3 to challenge that decision.

Brooks cannot meet the arbitration threshold, so she forwards the post to her friends.
