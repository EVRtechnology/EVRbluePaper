#### Philosophy

More often than not "Targeted content" creates echo-chambers, ill conceived ideological bubbles spawning incestuous ideologues that not only disconnect us from reality, but leave us at odds with it outright. Prescribed Customer-Journey aside, many of us unwittingly pigeonhole ourselves into a particular conceptual framework or area of interest.  Happily, we have no intention to pimp out our Membership base as customers for some neer-do-well highest-bidder.&#x20;

We cater content more as an algorithmic intervention than anything else; to keep confirmation biases in check and horizons expansive (rather than to usher folks down a rabbit hole). And importantly -we're explicit about it.

#### Examples

A lot of people in your area seem to derive great meaning from XXX guild in your area, maybe give them a try.

People in the area tend to respond to Opportunities offered between the hours of hh:mm and hh:mm, on a given day

You’re better at Sewing than you think. People tend to review you higher on competency than you review yourself on good-at-it.

You seem to enjoy working with your hands and there’s an abundance of opportunities for cabinetry in your area.
