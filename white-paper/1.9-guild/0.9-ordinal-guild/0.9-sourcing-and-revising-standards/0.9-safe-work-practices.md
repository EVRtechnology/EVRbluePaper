# 0.9 Safe Work Practices

#### Philosophy

Safe work practices are one of those things that absolutely has to happen for the sake of everybody involved, not only for liability purposes but for safety of end happiness and well-being of both teachers and Learners, address. For anybody who's going to be working in an environment with inherent risk it's also nice to have 8 default 80 fall back 8 standard to reference, so that nobody ends up needing to feel like they're mansplaining, or the bear giving unnecessary to ledge, or anything else. There is no resentment involved there is no skipping over things there's no taking things for granted. It's a way of making hazards explicit and about keeping people safe safe to do and safe to teach and about bringing up the things that people might not think of what the people may take for granted. Safe work practices get everybody on the same page with what is the safest way and one of the best things to get done, they take the combined experience and caution of everybody and they transmit that to the newbies, to the people who may not have that experience for that awareness yet. Safe work practices have an expiry date just like everything else because over time you get accustomed to it you get desensitized to different things and you can forget the East practices that you've learned, you can start taking things for granted you can start not seeing things, expert blindness is a big problem for people to take things for granted that other people know what the hell is going on and that they themselves. It's also handy to have these things expired or as has equipment this update as tired as processes in change there is the there's a continuity of knowing what those dangers are.
