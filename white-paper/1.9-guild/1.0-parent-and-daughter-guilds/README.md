# 1.0 Parent & Daughter guilds

#### Philosophy

Daughter guilds are born of Parent guilds through the process of Guild-creation. Thus a phylogenetic tree is established, facilitating navigation & content mediation on the platform.

The Parent-Daughter guild structure has more to do with inheritance than hierarchy.&#x20;

Parent guilds pass-on (in the sense of sharing) some of their members, their ethos, disposition, passion, knowledge (etc) to their progeny; and are the first called in to assist when a Daughter guild experiences a Dilemma it cannot resolve on its own.

But Daughter guilds are free to develop along whatever lines they wish. Indeed they are meant to branch off and head towards whatever compels them: -an area of interest undiscovered or undeveloped, -a geography under-served or under-represented. Whatever the niche, however novel or derivative, specialized or general, Guilds expand fractally to meet those needs where they arise.
