# 1.9 A Primer

#### In one sentence, what is the EVR\_app:&#x20;

EVR is a mobile application that helps you find your people, develop and maintain communities of practice (Guilds) based on shared interests. (En Vida Real = In Real Life)

#### In one paragraph, what does it do:

The app makes local opportunities visible and creates network connections while building reputation and providing social recognition. This is achieved by pairing the organizational & mapping power of social media with [anthropological insight](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] & basic human needs. The EVR\_app connects people not only through their latent interests but through specific actionable projects within Guilds. People are able to discover opportunities through these Guilds that are both location and skill specific.  Since Guilds are ‘user’-generated, they can become as fractal as need be; ensuring that people with even the most specific skills and interests will be able to find belonging.  Our mission is to help people on the app find their reason to wake up in the morning, their ‘Ikigai’

#### “Ikigai”?

_"…a Japanese concept referring to something that gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living."_

Middle intersection is called IKIGAI. Between what you love and what the world needs you usually get delight and fullness but no wealth, MISSION. Between what the world needs and what the world wants you get Vocation, excitement and complacency but sense of uncertainty. Between what the world wants and what you&#x27;re good at you get Profession which is comfortable but feeling of emptiness. And the last intersection of what you love and what you&#x27;re good at is Passion, which gives you satisfaction but a feeling of uselessness.  "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this model, Ikigai is found at the intersection of What you’re good at, What you love, What the world needs, and What the world wants. Our original inspiration for this app and all its features stem from a central question: _"what does it take to find your Ikigai"_ And so, each specific benefit offered by the EVR-app is built around a corresponding quadrant in the Ikigai Venn-diagram.
