# 0.9 Unethical

#### Philosophy

It is essential to allow a distinction between Unethical to the platform and Unfitting for the Guild

If sufficiently inclusive and properly empowered, any community is capable of self regulation without the need for a separate governing or policing authority.

Our Arbitration process is designed to provide the mechanisms for that empowerment.

#### Examples

Jimbo doesnt want to see a Klan rally

Jose doesnt want oil dumped into the river

Janice doesnt want people to kick puppies.
