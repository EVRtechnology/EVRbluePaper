# 1.0 Dilemmas Ethical and Procedural

#### Philosophy

People are neither inherently wicked or stupid; and while some things are best left to "the experts", most decisions are better off left to the rest of us.

Because while it's a given that no one is immune to bias, given a wide enough sampling of the general population they tend to cancel each other out. This aggregate result is not optimized to render the most  informed & conscientious decision possible (which is either Forward- or Backward- thinking depending on ones stance), but rather the most sensible & innocuous one (-something hopefully within the realm of fairness as most people see it). This is the way in which we address ethical dilemmas. Call it wisdom of the crowd, emergent intelligence, or simply a means to counter to Murphy's law of averages, the refrain from Bob Marley rings true: \~You can fool some people sometimes, but you cant fool all the people all the time.

Technical expertise or specialty knowledge isn't a requisite (and shouldn't be) for most all ethical dilemmas, it certainly is for Procedural dilemmas .&#x20;

What distinguishes an ethical dilemma from a procedural one is the scope of those impacted.&#x20;

comes down to a question of responsibility -no moral authority,&#x20;

moral SUPER majority&#x20;

&#x20;two distinct flavors: Ethical and Procedural,&#x20;

While either can have far ranging implications, one requires a specific familiarity, the other is general.&#x20;

same format, same needs, different requirements/scope of involvement, whom it involves, RESPOSIBILITY
