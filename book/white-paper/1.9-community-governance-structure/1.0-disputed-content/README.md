# 1.0 Disputed Content

#### Philosophy

Arbitrating members deserve clear and concise presentation of the issue at hand with the minimum amount of extraneous detail possible. We remove identifying information about posting members in hopes centering attention on the merit of the content alone, to prevent bias from visual cues, and to protect the identity of all members involved in the process.

#### Examples

A post about knitting in a crochet guild&#x20;

A post to throw pennies of a tall building

A post that contains hate speech
