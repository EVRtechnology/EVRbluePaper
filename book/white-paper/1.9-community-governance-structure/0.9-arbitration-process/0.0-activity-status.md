# 0.0 Activity Status

#### WHY

why we care about activity status: Expected turn out rate, adjusts to make processes go smoother, Inactivity doesn't slow down processes

#### Examples

In a guild of 100 people, 90 are active. to form a new subguild, only 60 votes are needed.

A guild of 9 people, 4 are active, a procedural dilemma involves the parent guild quickly.
