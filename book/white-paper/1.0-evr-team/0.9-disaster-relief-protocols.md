# 0.9 Disaster Relief Protocols

#### Philosophy

In times of crisis, the vast majority of people have the instinct to help. Yet what we’re told is to stay out of the way, and wait for help to arrive. This approach is mistaken, not only because it breeds a sense of helplessness and of dependency, and not only because it disregards valuable resources that could easily mitigate material and psychological damages; but because it strips us of a prime opportunity to build community resilience, interdependence, and gratitude.

Coordinating the response of agencies and volunteers.

The challenge is to identify likely hazards & needs, determine the necessary functions for each contingency, and prescribe the roles to be taken before disaster strikes.

#### Examples

Shayna is in a high risk area for fire and has a 100 head of goats, but not a large enough livestock trailer to transport them all. -Jimbo has a cattle trailer large enough to transport the herd if fire should threaten the region.

Marissa is 95 years old and lives alone, she requires a climate controlled environment to withstand extreme temperatures. Jenna has a wood burning stove and can offer a warm place to stay if the power goes out,

Shelly runs a bakery, she’s offered to feed people displaced by flooding.
