# 1.9 Billings Score

#### Philosophy

Consensus, not fervor, should guide discourse and decision making.

“I hate to be a kicker, I always long for peace, but the wheel that squeaks the loudest, is the one that gets the grease” Josh Billings, American Humorist, 1818-1885

The Billings Score is meant to mitigate this ubiquitous phenomenon, and reduce instances of unnecessary arbitration.

A simple calculation, based on the outcomes of past Dilemmas, intended to act as a bulwark against the failures of good judgement that express themselves as groundless complaints, perverse agendas, and inflammatory or derogatory exposition.

The time and attention of our Member base is a valuable asset, not an entitlement; their effort involved in Arbitration should be revered, and asked of with reserve.

This is not a stage, you are not an entertainer, this is not your audience.

#### Examples

Dilbert flags every post he sees made by Feminists, Communists, or Seventh Day Adventists.

Delilah really thinks her nutritionist guild needs a breathatarian sub-guild.

Denise seems to be pursuing a vendetta against anything star-wars, or star-wars adjacent.&#x20;
