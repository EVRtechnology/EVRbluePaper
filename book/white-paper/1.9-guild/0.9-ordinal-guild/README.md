# 0.9 Ordinal Guild

#### Philosophy

Its handy to know which direction to go (hence compass emblem), and the specific steps necessary to achieve your goal. Ordinal guilds offer something in addition to the community regular pins offer, they offer a great forward 4 words voice recognition that extends beyond the borders of the guild. Ordinal gills are typically more developed more objective oriented, and there's nothing wrong with gills that are not work no more. It's just that or no guilt offer more structure people looking to progress with end that skill-set. Ordinal guilds offer a sort of clarity of a sort of structure that give guidance, just by warrant of being as they are. And yes they do take a bit more consensus a bit more collaboration to put together. But they don't have to be handed down it doesn't have to be a hierarchical top to bottom sort of ordination. Ordinal Guild's can be built and are built by the members who I've spent time doing the thing. Who want to provide that structure and that framework for their members so that all people and Rise together and love one another up and a prescribed sort of manner. And the prescription is something that's written by people who know how to do the f\*\*\*\*\*\* thing. And the prescription is something that's written by people who know how to do the f\*\*\*\*\*\* thing. Not through speculation. Through a whole bunch of them we're not through a hope and a prayer, but with the guidance of people who have done the damn thing, establishing ordinal Guild as basically reaching a ladder down with Ronnie's to help other people get to where you are at. To help bring the entire guild membership up to that level. It's a thing that helps remove exclusivity and replaces exclusively with inclusivity because you're letting people now how to get where they want to be, letting people know how to get where you are at, as a way to get the entire guild membership all the people give a s\*\*\* about the thing to the place where they are as functional as the highest performing members of that killed.
