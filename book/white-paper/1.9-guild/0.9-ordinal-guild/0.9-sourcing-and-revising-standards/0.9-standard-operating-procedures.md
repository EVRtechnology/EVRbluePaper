# 0.9 Standard Operating Procedures

#### Philosophy

Standing BC every guild is different, its not “standard” across industry necessary. Standing operating procedures benefit both the guild itself and the end of the 12 member of The Guild because they reduce confusion, because there's a thing to rely back on to reference to, and they can be updated as neatly as things change as equipment and processes and Dynamics changed they can be modified. It's also handy to be able to know the distinct differences the discrete differences between below the last job and the way things are done here it can avoid so much different confusion, and because they are valuable because they are modifiable because they are updated, they can keep everybody on the same page, and they can increase efficiency and they can increase expectations they can increase decrease questions, so rather than having to rely on one person as an authority or hearsay or convention, when the thing is formalised you don't have to rely on he said she said I was trained or taught or introduce Wong. standard operating procedures and also question, sir I wasn't questioning one person or one Central Authority or thinking that it's a point mutation that one person doing something wrong you can assess the whole thing at once, you are left with wondering if things aren't working because of one person or another person, you can know when it's a system loss when the things that you're doing and that you're telling people to do isn't f\*\*\*\*\*\* working right. You can do a comparative analysis between different guilds between different businesses between different and you can see which procedures which processes work best and which are lacking, by paying careful attention to by formalizing standing operating procedures you can see you can break down the components of a process into things that are digestible by people and things are scrutable by organizations that are interested in optimizing their output in their performance. And you can let people know what they're getting into what a job entails what her profession entails what a trade in towns, people know beforehand what they're getting into standards they will be held to Luxor. Wonder workshop look like what to expect People know what to expect from one another and what to expect from a guild, they know how the business gets down, they know and they can plan around that.
