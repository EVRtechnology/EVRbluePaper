# 1.0 Guild Creation

#### Philosophy

Guild creation provides for EVR what division-of-labour does for an organization, only better.&#x20;

It allows our members to decide their own specific areas of interest, co-create a body of practice to pursue them, and to specialize in that field. It serves to increase the quality, quantity, and applicability of Opportunities overall; while maintaining cohesion & accountability via the Parent-Daughter relationship established between guilds.&#x20;

It's commonly held that the division of labor helps to increase output, trade, and interdependence  amongst parties in an economic system. Our belief is that the allowing for differentiation within Communities of Practice will do something similar for the EVR community.

#### Examples

Members of _Silicon Valley Developers_ Guild created a Daughter guild to further their specific interest, calling it the _Fortran Fanatics_ guild.

Opportunities in the _NYC ShoeMakers_ Guild were a bit too spread out, so they created 2 additional guilds: _NW Cordwainer's Club_, then the _SE Cobblers Co-op_

Members of _Bitcoin-Bros_ and _Dogecoin-Dudetttes_  co-parented a new guild to celebrate their shared interests: the _Coin-Head-Collective._
