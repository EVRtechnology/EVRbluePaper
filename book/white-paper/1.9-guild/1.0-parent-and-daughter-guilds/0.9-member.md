#### Philosophy

Our regret is that membership in the Evr community is limited to those with the cognitive & physical functions, material resources, and circumstances necessary to access the app. We acknowledge this as a shortcoming of our design and will rectify this as solutions become available.

#### Examples

Sue got her account today, she is a member of the Evr community Mackleighlah is a member of 4 different guilds

Sean is a member of 12 different guilds
