# 0.0 Proposal

#### Overview

This is the means for a guild to develop and adapt to changes as it sees fit.

Proposals involve only active members of a that guild.

Proposals may contain the identity of members making proposals.

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Begins in much the same way a procedural dilemma does, requiring a brief outlining the specific changes/ actions suggested, and a combined cuculus score above the potenza threshold. Proposals are then sent through a succession of arbitration processes, till a determination is reached.

In contrast to Dilemmas, Proposals collect feedback and comments from arbitrators along the way.
