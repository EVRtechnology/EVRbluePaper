# 1.0 Disputed content

#### Overview

Content intended as the subject of arbitration, it is combined with a brief to be presented as a dilemma.

Content is disputed on either procedural or ethical grounds as being either unfitting (procedural grounds), or unethical (ethical grounds).

Disputed content can be identified by any member of the EVR community

When disputed content is presented in a dilemma, identifying information about the posting member (person who created the content that is now being disputed) is removed.
