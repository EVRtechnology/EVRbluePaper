# 1.0 Arbitrating Members

#### Overview

The selection criteria for Members arbitrating Ethical Dilemmas, is that they belong to the relevant Regional Language Family, so as understand the words and expressions being used.

For Procedural Dilemas, selected members must also belong to the relevant Guild, or Parent Guild, to ensure familiarity with the subject matter at hand.

The amount of Members needed for Arbitration is 3 times that of the Disputed Content’s Arbitration Threshold.

Members will not be selected to arbitrate on the same Dilemma more than once.

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

When an Ethical or Procedural Dilemma presents itself, selected candidates are sent notification of their selection,

Candidates are given the option to participate in, or opt out of arbitration. If a particular candidate opts out, another will be presented with the offer.

Arbitrators are presented with the Dilemma, and provided three options: Agree, Disagree, Unsure, .

Responses of “Unsure” are counted as a non-response, and an alternate candidate will be presented with the offer.
