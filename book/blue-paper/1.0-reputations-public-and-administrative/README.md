# 1.0 Reputations: Public & Administrative

#### Overview

Public Reputations work to encourage pro-social behavior.&#x20;

Administrative Reputations work to disencourage anti-social behaviour.&#x20;

Public Reputations are visible to others, and serve to assist in decisions about whom to engage with, & in what capacity. They concern aspects of Aptitude, Nature, and Communication. They are earned through Verified Interactions with members of the EVR community, and issued via the Social Recognition Software

Administrative Reputations are invisible to others, and serve keep the platform running smoothly. They include a member's BillingsScore, PotenzaIndex, and Bayesian disposition \[<mark style="color:red;">bayes adjustment, or something simiar -the bias coutering thing</mark>]. They are earned through participation in Content Mediation, and Engagement-Review process \[<mark style="color:red;">make a page explaining this</mark>], and issued via the Community Governance Structure.

There are many other factors (explicit, implied, & circumstantial) that factor into individual & administrative decision making: Awards, achievements, flags, guild membership, time-in-guild, rank, geography, availability, etc. But Reputations are the most meritocratic (and we believe most valuable) distinction.

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

During the content mediation process

Following the Engagement review process

During the \[whatever we're calling guild decision making process]
