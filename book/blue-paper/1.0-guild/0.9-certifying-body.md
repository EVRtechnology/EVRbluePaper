# 0.9 Certifying Body

#### Overview

Agency, institution, or other authority who issues a stamp of approval for the FDC, SOP, SWP, and charter of a guild

Can be any existant internal or external agency,

Allows for authority to act unilaterally for that guild, but cannot undo what has already been done.

Requires tweaks to decision making process of the CGS in defining all of the above.

Certification comes with a time stamp, most relevant one is shown.

Do we charge extra for this? Can we automate the process? Change the expiry date for Practice Facs, Amend who is able to sign off.on things Can include off-app requirements/validations (degree programs etc) Can relieve feedback from people in an anonymous way?

Can revoke/ suspend certification of certain people

Building code place removes someones electrical license CBA believes the starting a coal fire skillset does not depreciate. After an inspection, USDA removes organic certification
