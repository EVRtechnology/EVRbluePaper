# 1.0 EVR Community

#### Overview

The Evr community is more than just a collection of individuals, it is the network of relationships that forms between them.

Our platform acts as a scaffolding by which people discover and develop their mutual interests. The people we serve are not “consumers” they are Members -active participants in the process of crafting and curating their own unique networks of interdependence and reciprocity.

Everything about this platform exists exclusively to make this community possible.

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Members create community by engaging with one another En Vida Real (in real life) through opportunities.
