# 1.0 Member

#### Overview

By default, all persons with an Evr account are a part of the Evr community (Evr guild),

A person may have Membership in any number of guilds, provided they meet the minimum requirements for that guild.

Membership status is used in determining whom has authority to post content and arbitrate in procedural dilemmas for a specified guild.

#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Membership in the Evr community (guild) is granted to all persons possessing an Evr account. Subsequent membership in subguilds is earned by meeting the minimum requirements for that guild (these could a set number of successful engagements within the context of that guild, or demonstrated proficiencies as outlined by that guild)
